# -------------------------------------------- PUBSPEC --------------------------------------------
# This file manages the project's name, version, metadata, dependencies (like for example Flutter), the SDK environment and other configurations
# Indentation is VERY important in YAML, and you should use spaces, NOT tabs
# TWO SPACES is the standard for a SINGLE INDENTATION

# -----------------------------------BASIC INFO-----------------------------------
name: lg_master_web_app  # Name of the project
                         # Should be unique within your workspace
                         # Use ONLY lowercase letters, numbers and underscores
                         # NO spaces or special characters are allowed
description: ALEIX CLIMENT'S SUBMISSION OF TASK 2 (A BASIC FLUTTER APP) # Short description of the project
                                                                         # This is shown on packages websites or tools

#publish_to: 'none'  # This line means that the package will NOT be published it on pub.dev, the official package repository of Dart and Flutter
                     # This is useful for private or internal projects
                     # GSoC is open source, so you should NOT use this line for an open source project, but is useful to know it exists

# -----------------------------------VERSION-----------------------------------
version: 1.0.0+1  # The app version, helps keep track of updates and changes
                  # The format is major.minor.patch+build
                  # The first official and stable release would be 1.0.0+1
                  # major = 1 for the initial public release of the app
                  # minor = 0 because there have been no minor updates/additions yet
                  # patch = 0 because there have been no bug fixes or small changes yet
                  # build = 1 for the very first build of the app
                  # The build part is specially important for mobile app stores to differentiate between builds with the same semantic version
                  # Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter build by specifying --build-name and --build-number (respectively)
                  # In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode
                  # In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion
                  # In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix

# -----------------------------------ENVIRONMENT-----------------------------------
# It specifies which versions of the SDK the project works with, it helps prevent compatibility issues
environment:
  sdk: ">=3.0.0 <4.0.0"  # This is just an example value
                         # >=3.0.0 means that the project requires AT LEAST version 3.0.0 of the Dart SDK
                         # <4.0.0 means that the project will work with any Dart SDK version LOWER than 4.0.0
                         # To sum up, with this example the project will only work if the Dart SDK version is 3.0.0 or higher but less than 4.0.0

# -----------------------------------DEPENDENCIES-----------------------------------
# Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work
# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions, you can run `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`
# Dependencies can also be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to # the latest version available on pub.dev
# To see which dependencies have newer, versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter # This is the most basic dependency, as this line means that the project depends on Flutter itself
                 # This line is mandatory for all Flutter apps, since it provides the core framework and widgets

  shared_preferences: ^2.2.0  # This line allows to store simple key-value data
                              # It is usually used to save user settings locally

  provider: ^6.1.0  # This line is used to share and manage states (user data, theme settings, etc.) between widgets
  
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.8   # This line adds the Cupertino Icons font
                            # You can use it with the CupertinoIcons class for iOS style icons

  dartssh2: ^2.5.1  # This line allows you to use ssh to connect to the Liquid Galaxy

  google_maps_flutter: ^2.2.2  # Enables embedding and interacting with Google Maps

  xml: ^6.1.0  # This line allows the parsing of KML files (since they are XML-formatted files)

  http: ^1.1.0  # This line adds the HTTP client library, used to make HTTP requests to web servers

  url_launcher: ^6.2.5  # This line allows you to open URLs in browser or apps

  mobile_scanner: ^3.5.7 # This line allows you to use your phone camera in order to scan something

  flutter_dotenv: ^5.1.0  # Adds support for environment variables
                          # Useful for loading configuration or secret keys from .env files
  
  path_provider: ^2.1.5  # Used to find locations on the app filesystem

# dev_dependencies are packages needed ONLY during development and testing, for example testing, code formatting or generating files
# These packages are NOT needed when the app runs for users and are NOT included in the final app that users download
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter # This is the most basic developer dependency, as this line means that Flutter helps write tests for the app

  # The "flutter_lints" package contains a set of recommended lints to encourage good coding practices
  # The lint set provided by the package is activated in the `analysis_options.yaml` file located at the root of your package
  # See that file for information about deactivating specific lint rules and activating additional ones
  flutter_lints: ^6.0.0

# -----------------------------------FLUTTER PACKAGES-----------------------------------
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true # Material Design is an open-source design system developed by Google
                             # This line enables the use of Material Design icons and themes for the app
                             # If the value of this line was 'false' instead of 'true', Material icons would not be able to use without extra configurations

  # ------------ASSETS------------
  # Must be INSIDE the flutter section!!!
  # In this section you can declare the files (images, audio, JSON, etc.) that the app needs
  # Each asset path is relative to the project root and must match the actual file/folder location
  # If the files and/or folders do not exist at the specified paths, Flutter will show an error
  # After adding assets, run 'flutter pub get' to update the project

  assets:
    - assets/images/LGMasterWebAppLogo.png   # Line needed to use the project logo on the splash screen
    - assets/images/FacensLogo.png           # Line needed to use the Facens logo on the splash screen
    - assets/images/FlutterLleidaLogo.jpg    # Line needed to use the Flutter Lleida logo on the splash screen

    - assets/icons/github_logo.png      # Line needed to use the github logo on the help screen
    - assets/kml/pyramid.kml             # LINE NEEDED TO USE THE PYRAMID KML
    
    # INFO ON HOW TO ADD DIFFERENT ASSETS:
    # - assets/images/logo.png    # Adds a single image file, in this case called 'logo.png' from the 'images' folder
                                  # You could reference this asset in the Dart code using, for example, Image.asset('assets/images/logo.png')
                            
    # - assets/audio/music.mp3    # Adds a single audio file, in this case called 'music.mp3' from the 'audio' folder

    # - assets/data/config.json   # Adds a single JSON configuration file, in this case called 'config.json' from the 'data' folder

    # - assets/images/            # If it ends with '/' it adds all the files in a folder, in this case all the files from the 'images' folder

  # ------------FONTS------------
  # Must be INSIDE the flutter section!!!
  # In this section you can include custom fonts
  # Each font is relative to the project root and must match the actual file/folder location
  # If the files and/or folders do not exist at the specified paths, Flutter will show an error
  # After adding fonts, run 'flutter pub get' to update the project

  # You must specify a 'family' (font) name and one or more font files for that family
  # 'fonts:' MUST BE A LIST (using '-'), and INSIDE 'fonts' is where you specify the different families you will be using for your project
  # Each font file can also specify an optional 'weight' and 'style'

  #fonts:
    # Example with OpenSans:
    # - family: OpenSans # Name that will be used in the Dart code (fontFamily: 'OpenSans')
                       # You can give the family any name you want, but it's easier if you just name if like the font you are using
      # fonts:
        # - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Regular.ttf   # Path to the regular font file
        # - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Italic.ttf    # Path to the italic font file
        #  style: italic                       # Optional, in this case specifies this file is the italic style for this font
      
        # - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Bold.ttf      # Path to the bold font file
        #  weight: 700                         # Optional, in this case specifies this file is the bold option for this font and that its weight is 700

      # In Dart code, you can use this font like this:
      # Text('Hello world', style: TextStyle(fontFamily: 'OpenSans'))

    # Example with Roboto:
    #- family: Roboto # Name that will be used in the Dart code (fontFamily: 'Roboto')
    #  fonts:
    #    - asset: fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf   # Path to the regular font file
    #    - asset: fonts/Roboto-Italic.ttf    # Path to the italic font file
    #      style: italic                     # Optional, in this case specifies this file is the italic style for this font
      
    #    - asset: fonts/Roboto-Bold.ttf      # Path to the bold font file
    #      weight: 400                       # Optional, in this case specifies this file is the bold option for this font and that its weight is 400

    # In Dart code, you can use this font like this:
    # Text('Hello world', style: TextStyle(fontFamily: 'Roboto'))
