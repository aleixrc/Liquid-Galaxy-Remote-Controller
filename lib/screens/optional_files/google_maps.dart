// -------------------------------------------- GOOGLE MAPS SCREEN --------------------------------------------
// ----------------------------------------- EXTERNAL BROWSER VERSION  ----------------------------------------
// This screen gives information about how to integrates Google Maps on your project opening the map with an external browser
// For that, you have to create a map in Google Maps and get a public URL to share it

// ---------------------- Import packages ----------------------
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Imports the library material.dart (which contains common widgets like buttons, text, etc.) from Flutter's SDK (Software Development Kit)
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart'; // Used to open URLs in browser or apps, must also be added on the pubspec.yaml file
// For this to work on Android emulator, add permission to us ethe internet in the Android manifest!!
// Check the AndroidManifest.xml file for more info
// Emulators do not have a browser, try on real phone

// ---------------------- Google Maps Screen widget ----------------------
// GoogleMapsScreen class is the root widget of the screen, and all other widgets are built from there
// This means that all the other parts of the screen (buttons, text, etc) will be built from this starting point
// It extends StatelessWidget, which is a type of widget that never changes once it appears on the screen
// If we wanted the widget to react to the users actions or update automatically (for example, a counter), we would use StatefulWidget
class GoogleMapsScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  const GoogleMapsScreen({super.key});
  // 'super' indicates that, if this widget receives a key, it will be passed to the parent class so Flutter knows about it
  // This helps Flutter identify and track this widget when rebuilding the screen
  // It basically passes an optional key to the parent widget for identification during widget rebuilds

  final String mapsUrl =
      'https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=1_n73uHh2o_GhqjYBGkhaFzHW2zNJQ10&usp';
  // This is the public URL to your public Google Maps
  // In this case I created a sample map with the 7 wonders of the modern world
  // Then I clicked share and got the public link to share the map
  // You have to replace this with your actual publicly accessible URL
  // IMPORTANT!!!! This URL must be public to work
  // IMPORTANT!! It will NOT work if it has the word 'edit'
  // The structure of the URL should be this one:
  // https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=YOUR_MAP_ID
  // This also means you have to be careful so that this map does NOT contain any sensitive information (for example, your address)

  // ---------------------- Open Google Maps method ----------------------
  Future<void> _openGoogleMaps() async {
    // Defines an asynchronous method that does not return any value (void)
    // 'async' allows to use 'await' inside the function
    // It does not return any value because its function is to trigger a side-effect (connecting to a service), not to return data

    final Uri uri = Uri.parse(mapsUrl);
    // This line parses the URL string into a Uri object, which is required by launchUrl
    // 'Uri' is a built-in Dart class that represents a standard way to identify URLs
    // Uri.parse() is a method that takes a string (in this case, mapsWebUrl) and converts it into a Uri object
    // The Uri object that we get as a result of this parsing that can be used safely with other APIs

    // ------- Checking if the URL can be opened -------
    if (await canLaunchUrl(uri)) {
      // 'await' pauses execution, it is used in asynchronous functions
      // This is because these functions takes some time to complete and we need to wait for its result
      // 'canLaunchUrl(uri)' checks if the device is capable of launching the specified Uri

      await launchUrl(uri, mode: LaunchMode.externalApplication);
      // If the device is capable of launching the Uri (opening the URL, in other words), this line is executed
      // 'launchUrl()' opens the URL
      // 'uri' is the Uri object containing the web address to be opened
      // LaunchMode.externalApplication tells Flutter to open the URL using an external application rather than inside the app itself
      // This application can be, for example, a web browser or the Google Maps app
    } else {
      // If the device is NOT capable of opening the URL, this line is executed

      debugPrint('Could not launch $mapsUrl');
      // It prints an error to the console for debugging, specifying the URL used
      // This message is NOT shown to the user, is just for debugging purposes
    }
  }

  // ---------------------- Build the screen interface ----------------------
  // This function defines what the screen looks like, it is basically method used to build the UI of this widget
  // The parameter context gives access to theme, size, etc

  @override
  // @override is a line that indicates a method from the parent class is going to be replaced
  // In this case, we are replacing the build() method that comes from Flutter's State class
  // @override is not mandatory but it is really useful, as it helps catch mistakes
  // Dart will show an error if you try to override something that does not exist

        // If you wanted to add padding on top and bottom you would use EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 24.0);
        // If you wanted to add padding on left and right you would use EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 24.0);
        // You can also combine both, for example EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 8.0, horizontal: 12.0),
        // You can add padding on individual sides, for example:
        // EdgeInsets.only(left: 8.0, bottom: 5.0, top: 10.0, right: 20.0)
