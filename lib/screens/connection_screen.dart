// -------------------------------------------- CONNECTION SCREEN --------------------------------------------
// This is the screen where the user will introduce the IP and the port related to the Liquid Galaxy
// As well as other LG connection options like clearing KMLs, saving credentials or disconnecting the LG

// ---------------------- Import packages ----------------------
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Imports the library material.dart (which contains common widgets like buttons, text, etc.) from Flutter's SDK (Software Development Kit)
import 'package:provider/provider.dart'; // Imports the library provider.dart (which contains tools to manage the app state)
import '../../services/lg_service.dart'; // Imports the LG service screen, which handles the logic to connect to the Liquid Galaxy screen
import '../../providers/settings_provider.dart'; // Imports the file we created to manage font sizes
import 'dart:convert'; // For coding and decoding JSON
import 'optional_files/qr.dart'; // Imports the file we created to manage the scanning of a QR code

// ---------------------- Connection screen widget ----------------------
// ConnectionScreen class is the root widget of the screen, and all other widgets are built from there
// This means that all the other parts of the screen (buttons, text, etc) will be built from this starting point
// It extends StatefulWidget because its state changes after a few seconds
// If it did NOT change, we would use StatelessWidget
class ConnectionScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  const ConnectionScreen({super.key});
  // 'super' indicates that, if this widget receives a key, it will be passed to the parent class so Flutter knows about it
  // This helps Flutter identify and track this widget when rebuilding the screen
  // It basically passes an optional key to the parent widget for identification during widget rebuilds

  @override
  // @override is a line that indicates a method from the parent class is going to be replaced
  // In this case, we are replacing the createState() method that comes from Flutter's State class
  // @override is not mandatory but it is really useful, as it helps catch mistakes
  // Dart will show an error if you try to override something that does not exist

// ---------------------- Connection screen state ----------------------
// This class manages the state (in other words, the behavior) of the connection screen
// In this case, it triggers the connection attempt
// The state of a widget is basically the changing data
// In Flutter a State class is where the data that can be changed while the app is running is stored and managed
// When the state changes, the widget rebuilds itself to show the new data
