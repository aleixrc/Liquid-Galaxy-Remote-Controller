// -------------------------------------------- OPTIONAL SCREEN --------------------------------------------
// In this screen you will be able to explore some optional implementations for your project
// You have the opportunity of incorporating AI, Google Maps and Nodejs

// ---------------------- Import packages ----------------------
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Imports the library material.dart (which contains common widgets like buttons, text, etc.) from Flutter's SDK (Software Development Kit)
import 'optional_files/google_maps.dart'; // Imports the screen related to the Google Maps external browser explanation and example
import 'optional_files/kml.dart'; // Imports the screen related to the Google Maps internal browser explanation and example
import 'optional_files/nodejs.dart'; // Imports the screen related to the Nodejs explanation and example
import 'optional_files/ai.dart'; // Imports the screen related to the AI explanation and example

// ---------------------- Optional screen widget ----------------------
// OptionalScreen class is the root widget of the screen, and all other widgets are built from there
// This means that all the other parts of the screen (buttons, text, etc) will be built from this starting point
// It extends StatelessWidget, which is a type of widget that never changes once it appears on the screen
// If we wanted the widget to react to the users actions or update automatically (for example, a counter), we would use StatefulWidget
class OptionalScreen extends StatelessWidget {
  const OptionalScreen({super.key});
  // 'super' indicates that, if this widget receives a key, it will be passed to the parent class so Flutter knows about it
  // This helps Flutter identify and track this widget when rebuilding the screen
  // It basically passes an optional key to the parent widget for identification during widget rebuilds

  @override
  // @override is a line that indicates a method from the parent class is going to be replaced
  // In this case, we are replacing the initState() method that comes from Flutter's State class
  // @override is not mandatory but it is really useful, as it helps catch mistakes
  // Dart will show an error if you try to override something that does not exist

  // ---------------------- Build the screen interface ----------------------
  // This function defines what the screen looks like, it is basically method used to build the UI of this widget
  // The parameter context gives access to theme, size, etc
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      // Scaffold is a basic page layout that creates an structure for the screen

        // Adds padding of 20 px to all sides (top, bottom, left, right)
        // If you wanted to add padding on top and bottom you would use EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 24.0);
        // If you wanted to add padding on left and right you would use EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 24.0);
        // You can also combine both, for example EdgeInsets.symmetric(vertical: 8.0, horizontal: 12.0),
        // You can add padding on individual sides, for example:
        // EdgeInsets.only(left: 8.0, bottom: 5.0, top: 10.0, right: 20.0)
