// -------------------------------------------- SPLASH SCREEN --------------------------------------------
// A splash screen is typically a welcome screen that appears when we open an app
// In this case, it will display the logos of Liquid Galaxy and your project
// It will also display other logos related to Liquid Galaxy and to any tools you have used on your project
// The logos displayed in this project are the basic and mandatory ones

// ---------------------- Import packages ----------------------
import 'dart:async'; // Imports the Dart asynchronous tools needed for Timer
import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; // Imports the library material.dart (which contains common widgets like buttons, text, etc.) from Flutter's SDK (Software Development Kit)
import 'main_screen.dart'; // Imports the main screen file so we can navigate to it after the logos disappear

// ---------------------- Splash screen widget ----------------------
// SplashScreen class is the root widget of the screen, and all other widgets are built from there
// This means that all the other parts of the screen (buttons, text, etc) will be built from this starting point
// It extends StatefulWidget because its state changes after a few seconds
// If it did NOT change, we would use StatelessWidget
class SplashScreen extends StatefulWidget {
  const SplashScreen({super.key});
  // 'super' indicates that, if this widget receives a key, it will be passed to the parent class so Flutter knows about it
  // This helps Flutter identify and track this widget when rebuilding the screen
  // It basically passes an optional key to the parent widget for identification during widget rebuilds

  @override
  // @override is a line that indicates a method from the parent class is going to be replaced
  // In this case, we are replacing the initState() method that comes from Flutter's State class
  // @override is not mandatory but it is really useful, as it helps catch mistakes
  // Dart will show an error if you try to override something that does not exist

  State<SplashScreen> createState() => _SplashScreenState();
  // This line creates the mutable state associated with SplashScreen
  // The state object will hold the logic for what the splash screen does
}

// ---------------------- Splash screen state ----------------------
// This class manages the state (in other words, the behavior) of the splash screen
// The state of a widget is basically the changing data
// In Flutter a State class is where the data that can be changed while the app is running is stored and managed
// When the state changes, the widget rebuilds itself to show the new data
class _SplashScreenState extends State<SplashScreen> {
  Timer? _timer;
  // Declares a private variable named "_timer" that can store a Timer object

  @override
  // @override is a line that indicates a method from the parent class is going to be replaced
  // In this case, we are replacing the initState() method that comes from Flutter's State class
  // @override is not mandatory but it is really useful, as it helps catch mistakes
  // Dart will show an error if you try to override something that does not exist

  void initState() {
    // initState() is a method that runs once when the screen first loads or the widget is first created
    // It acts as a setup function, and that is why is only run once
    // Once the setup is done there's no need to set up everything again (unless the widget is removed and added back)

    super.initState();
    // super.initState() calls the default setup behavior from the parent class (in this case, the State class from Flutter)
    // It basically indicates Flutter to set up its own things first, and then we'll add our own things later

    Timer(const Duration(seconds: 3), () {
      // Navigate to MainScreen after 3 seconds
      // After 3 seconds, it navigates to the main screen and replaces the splash screen, which means users cannot go back to the Splash screen

      // This is just an example value, you can put the time you want
      // However, keep in mind that this is a splash screen, so do not put a value that is too high
      // Just keep in mind that the value has to be an int (1, 2, 3, 4, etc)!!
      // It CANNOT be a float (1.2, 2.6, 3.1, 4.8, etc)
      // If you want a delay like, for example, 2.5 seconds, you can convert it to milliseconds the following way:
      // Timer(const Duration(milliseconds: 2500), () {});

      if (!mounted) return;
      // "mounted" is a property of the State class that is "true" if the widget is currently displayed on the screen
      // This line means that, if the widget has been removed from the screen, the function should exit early (return)

      Navigator.of(
        context,
        // 'context' represents the location of the current widget in the widget tree
        // Flutter uses it to know where to place the new screen in the navigation hierarchy
      ).pushReplacement(MaterialPageRoute(
          // MaterialPageRoute is like a page transition in a Material Design style
          // It is used to build the main screen widget

          builder: (_) => const MainScreen()));
    });
  }

  @override
  // @override is a line that indicates a method from the parent class is going to be replaced
  // In this case, we are replacing the dispose() method that comes from Flutter's State class
  // @override is not mandatory but it is really useful, as it helps catch mistakes
  // Dart will show an error if you try to override something that does not exist

  void dispose() {
    // It does not return anything (void)
    // This method is called only once when the widget is permanently removed from the widget tree
    // Used to clean up resources

    _timer?.cancel();
    // Cancels the timer if it is not null
    // This makes sure the timer stops after the widget is gone

    super.dispose();
    // super.dispose() calls the parent class dispose() method
    // It basically indicates Flutter to set up its own things first, and then we'll add our own things later
  }

      backgroundColor: Colors.white,

      // You can choose any color you want, but white usually fits better because of the background of some logos

              // Both widgets must also be in different screens (Hero is meant for transitions, not in-place animations)
